You can find the deatil in this paper 
 ***S-RRT*-based obstacle avoidance autonomous motion planner for continuum-rigid manipulator. arXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19110***
 
 Run the "ReadAni_without.py" can obtain the animation for motion planning without the collision avoidance and "ReadAni_with.py" can obtain the animation for motion planning with the collision avoidance.
